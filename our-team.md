_Founder, Achintya Jha_

[Achintya Jha](https://achintyajha.in) is a class 12 student at Ahlcon International School, where he is studying the sciences along with Computer Science. He believes that innovations and ideas must be made accessible to all at no costs, and he is always working to give back to the society.

He is also the academic secretary of the Student Council and part of the organizing team of various annual CS events held in the school. His experience with technology has allowed him to develop solutions in the intersection of tech and society. He has developed [StuClan](https://stuclan.ml) and [SentiMate](https://sentimate.ml) after close to 2 years of research and aims to make these platforms available to everyone, for which, he is working on scaling this project further.

He has worked as an research intern at companies like Tech Mahindra and has volunteered at organisations like SEETalks, HappyPlus, ZenOnco and many others. For him, these experiences have revealed various problems and stigmas in the society, including mental health, and have encouraged him to come up with innovative solutions.

He would be beyond grateful, if you could [share](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fsentimate.ml%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Ebuttonembed%7Ctwterm%5Eshare%7Ctwgr%5E&text=Guys%20have%20a%20look%20at%20SentiMate!!%20It%20can%20detect%20depression%20using%20text!!&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsentimate.ml&via=achintyajha05)this website with your friends or send your feedback about the model and StuClan.
